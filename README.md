# Open FFBoard
The Open FFBoard is an open source force feedback interface with the goal of creating a platform for highly compatible simulation devices.

This firmware is optimized for the Open FFBoard. 
At the moment the software is far from finished. Features may not work completely or contain errors.

## Extensions
The modular structure means you are free to implement your own main classes. 
Take a look into the FFBoardMain and ExampleMain class files in the UserExtensions folder.
Helper functions for parsing CDC commands and accessing the flash are included.
